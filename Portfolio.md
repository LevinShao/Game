### **Identifying a Need**
**2D Roguelike Game Examples:**
- Dead Cells (2018)
- Slay the Spire (2019)
- The Binding of Isaac

**Dead Cells: PMI Table**
| Plus | Minus | Interesting |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Fluid and satisfying combat system | High difficulty may frustrate some players | Procedural generation keeps levels fresh |
| Gorgeous pixel art and atmospheric environments | Lack of traditional narrative depth | Permadeath adds tension and excitement |
| Responsive controls and tight platforming | Repetitive grind for new weapons and upgrades | Weapons and abilities can radically change playstyle |

**Slay the Spire: PMI Table**
| Plus | Minus | Interesting |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Innovative card-based combat system | Can feel repetitive over time | Deck-building mechanic adds layers of strategy |
| Highly strategic and requires deep thinking | Lack of animation and graphical excitement | Combines roguelike elements with card games |
| Every run feels different thanks to randomization | Some RNG can ruin good strategies in a single move | Synergizing cards can create powerful combos |

**The Binding of Isaac: PMI Table**
| Plus | Minus | Interesting |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Endless replayability due to randomization | Dark and grotesque themes may not appeal to everyone | Unpredictable combinations of items create unique experiences |
| Challenging yet rewarding gameplay | Can feel overwhelming with its many items and enemies | Procedurally generated rooms and item drops keep it exciting |
| Huge variety of items and power-ups | High level of difficulty, especially for newcomers | Story elements are delivered through cryptic clues and symbolism |

**Possible Game Ideas & User Needs:**
- **Procedural Generation:** Randomized levels, different themes, dynamic layouts
- **Combat Mechanics:** Weapon variety, special abilities, responsive controls
- **Lore:** Mystery plot, hidden secrets, narrative hints
- **Replayability:** Unlockable items, multiple endings, random events
- **User Interface:** Minimalist design, clear HUD, accessible options
- **Character Progression:** Skill trees, upgradeable weapons, unlockable abilities
- **Enemy AI:** Challenging enemies, boss fights, adaptive behavior
- **Sound Design:** Atmospheric music, unique sound effects, dynamic audio cues

**Need:** To provide players with an exciting and challenging 2D gaming experience that improves their skills at strategic thinking, adaptability, and quick decision-making through procedurally generated levels and increasingly difficult enemies in a 2D Roguelike game.

**Problem Statement:** Many players often seek games that offer both replayability and a dynamic challenge. A 2D Roguelike game that features procedurally generated environments, unique and challenging enemies, as well as randomized loot can satisfy this demand by requiring players to think strategically and adapt quickly to unpredictable situations. This game will offer a satisfying progression of difficulty, which will push players to refine their skills and develop new tactics with each playthrough.

**Skill Development:** To develop the necessary skills for making the game in Unity, I will need to study and complete the 2D Roguelike tutorial available on Unity Learn.
### **Requirements Outline**
**Inputs:** The user will need to control their player movement using either the basic WASD keys or the arrow keys. The players will jump by pressing the spacebar.
