### **Identifying a Need**
**Need:** To provide players with an exciting and challenging 2D gaming experience that improves their skills at strategic thinking, adaptability, and quick decision-making through procedurally generated levels and increasingly difficult enemies in a 2D Roguelike game.

**Problem Statement:** Many players often seek games that offer both replayability and a dynamic challenge. A 2D Roguelike game that features procedurally generated environments, unique and challenging enemies, as well as randomized loot can satisfy this demand by requiring players to think strategically and adapt quickly to unpredictable situations. This game will offer a satisfying progression of difficulty, which will push players to refine their skills and develop new tactics with each playthrough.

**Skill Development:** To develop the necessary skills for making the game in Unity, I will need to study and complete the 2D Roguelike tutorial available on Unity Learn.
